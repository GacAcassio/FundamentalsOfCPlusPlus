# Divisible By Eight

Help James to write a program to find the number divisible by eight.

Divisibility rule: If the last three numbers of a number is divisible by 8 , then the whole number is divisible by 8

Note:

    Provide the number as input. 
    Get the last three numbers using an array and print "Last three digits: xxx".
    Then divide it by 8,  if the remainder is zero, print "Number is divisible by 8".
    If the remainder is not zero, print "Number is not divisible by 8".

Implement the following method:

Implement 'main': In this method, get the number as input by the user and print the result as shown in the sample input/output. 

Note: Please avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:

99936

Sample Output 1:

Last three digits : 936
Number is divisible by 8

Sample Input 2:

5865

Sample Output 2:

Last three digits : 865
Number is not divisible by 8
