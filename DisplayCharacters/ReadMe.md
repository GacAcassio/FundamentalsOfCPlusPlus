# Display Calculation

Ralph wants to build a magic board that displays a character that corresponds to the given number (that is the ASCII value of the given character)for his science exhibition. Help him to develop such an application. 

The ASCII value of the lowercase alphabet is from 97 to 122. And, the ASCII value of the uppercase alphabet is from 65 to 90. If the number entered by the user lies in the range of 97 to 122 or from 65 to 90, the corresponding alphabet is displayed as output.

For example when the digits 65, 66 ,67, 68 are entered, these numbers are the ASCII values of alphabet A, B, C ,D. 

hint: [Assume the number of inputs is always 4 ]



Implement the following method.

Implement 'main'

Method signature, int main()

This method gets four ASCII codes (integers) as input by the user, then displays the corresponding character represented by that code. 

Note: Please avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:
Enter the digits:
65
66
67
68

Sample Output 1:
65-A
66-B
67-C
68-D



Sample Input 2:

Enter the digits:
102
110
113
121

Sample Output 2:

102-f
110-n
113-q
121-y
