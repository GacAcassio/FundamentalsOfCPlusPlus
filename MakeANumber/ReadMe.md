# Make a number

Mark gets n numbers in an array. Write a program considering only the single digit even numbers in the array and make a number by combining those even numbers alone.

If there are no single digit even numbers found in an array, then display the output message as â€œSingle digit even number is not found in the arrayâ€. If the array size is zero or lesser, then display the output message as â€œInvalid array sizeâ€.

Implement the following methods.

Implement â€˜mainâ€™: In this method, get the input by the user and store it in an array. Check if the given number in an array is having a single digit even number. Implement the logic by considering only the single digit even numbers.

For example:

Consider an input value {2,7,41,4} stored in an array. In the given array, get the single digit even numbers which are 2 and 4. Implement a logic using these even numbers, such that the output is 24.

Note: Please avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.
