# Find Season

Riya's teacher has asked her to prepare well on the topic Seasons. When her teacher asks a month, she needs to correctly tell the season corresponding to that month. Write a C++ program to solve the above task.

    Spring - March to May,
    Summer - June to August,
    Autumn - September to November and,
    Winter - December to February.

Note: The month should be in the range of 1 to 12. If not, the output should be â€œInvalid monthâ€.

Implement 'main': In this method, get the month (as a number) as input by the user and find the season based on the month input and display the output.

Note: Please avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:
Enter the month:11

Sample Output 1:
Season:Autumn

 

Sample Input 2:
Enter the month:13

Sample Output 2:
Invalid month
