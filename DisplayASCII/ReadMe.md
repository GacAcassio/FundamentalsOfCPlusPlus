# Display ASII

Rosh wants to build a magic board that displays ASCII values of the alphabets entered. Help him to develop such an application using C++. 

The ASCII value of the lowercase alphabets is from 97 to 122 (a-z) and the ASCII value of the uppercase alphabets is from 65 to 90 (A-Z).

If the character entered by the user is an alphabet, the corresponding ASCII value is displayed as an output.

For example, when the character 'A' is entered, the ASCII value of 'A' which is 65 is displayed.

Implement the method 'main' : This method gets the character as input by the user, displays the corresponding ASCII value, else displays "Invalid".

Note:
Use concepts of ascii values. 
Please avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:
Enter the letter
A
Sample Output 1:
A-65

Sample Input 2:
4
Sample Output 2:
Invalid
