#Increment Calculation

Hexon Technologies is in the process of revising the salary of their employees. The revision is done on their salary, based on their performance appraisal rating.

If the appraisal rating is between 1 and 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 3.1 and 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 4.1 and 5, the increment is 30% of the salary.
If the salary is 0 or negative, (or) if the appraisal rating is not in the range 1 to 5 (inclusive), then the output should be â€œInvalid Inputâ€.
